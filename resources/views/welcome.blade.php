					Last year immediately after the show, we launched our website with lofty goals in mind 
					
					<br><br>it looked like crap.<br><br>

					A few weeks later we moved to our "Dusk" theme because we had to prepare for nightfall.

					<br><br>it looked a bit less like crap.<br><br>

					 We hope you like the new "Nightfall" look -- we've got so much more than a cool website theme and new clothes this time around.

					<br><br>

					Thanks for sticking around,

			<h3 class="en-blog-title">Take 1. Scene: Northville Woods. Acti...cops.</h3>
				<p>
					We tried to shoot some footage in the woods near the Northville asylum (not the buildings) 
					because there's very few people back there to interrupt us while we do makeup and set up 
					scenes. See also: pour biodegradeable fake blood everywhere.<br><br>
					Two of us went ahead to find a suitable tree to climb and tie a pulley system to for a later scene -- mission accomplished --
					and by the time we got back to the group there was already a police officer kindly asking us to leave.
					We obliged. They took our names, you know, just in case we try to come back to film later. We ended up planning a different 
					scene, and moving approximately 1/2 mile down the road. Much ruckus was caused in a van in the middle of the night in Northville.
					<br><br>
					The cops had changed shifts at that point -- SO IT WASN'T THE SAME OFFICER WHO ASKED US TO VACATE THE SECOND LOCATION.
					<br><br>
					<br>
					<span style="font-size:1.3em">There's a valuable lesson here: 
					<br>
					Since we never get bothered when we're filming in the hood, police officers in Northville must be bored.
					<br>
					Also, they're paid ~20k more per year than their actual-crime-fighting counterparts in Detroit city proper. 
					<br><br>
					That's interesting. </span>
					<br><br>
					Don't forget to vote to end this "small government" bullshit parade in 2016.
